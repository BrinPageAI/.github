# BrinPage

**BrinPage** is a software company focused on building next-generation AI systems and developer tools to accelerate the future of intelligent computing.

## What we do

We develop proprietary AI models and software products that combine cutting-edge machine learning with intuitive user experiences. Our goal is to empower creators, developers, and businesses with tools that are fast, accessible, and deeply integrated with AI.

BrinPage is currently working on:

- **CGM**: A scalable code generation platform that helps users build production-ready web applications with minimal input.
- **BirdMind**: Our in-house AI model (in development), optimized for code understanding and generation.

## Our focus

At this stage, weâ€™re prioritizing:

- High-performance infrastructure for code generation.
- Seamless UX for developer and non-developer users alike.
- Research and fine-tuning of open-source AI models for our own stack.
- Preparing for early-stage startup acceleration and investment (Y Combinator, Microsoft for Startups, etc.).

## Repository access

At this time, all repositories under BrinPage are private. Public repositories and open-source tools may be released in the future.
