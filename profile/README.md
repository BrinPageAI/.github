### What is Brinpage?

Brinpage is a cloud platform for building AI-powered systems using agents.

It provides a centralized control plane where you can:

- Define AI agents with instructions and modular context  
- Attach tools and external services  
- Query databases and internal knowledge  
- Route requests across different models  
- Execute in real time  
- Reuse the same agents across multiple surfaces (chatbots, internal tools, APIs)

Instead of wiring everything manually, Brinpage handles agent orchestration so teams can focus on building product logic.

### Core concepts

- **Agents**  
  Autonomous units with instructions, context, and tool access.

- **Context modules**  
  Structured knowledge sources (databases, documents, files, APIs).

- **Tools**  
  External services or internal endpoints agents can call.

- **Routing**  
  Dynamic model selection and request handling.

- **Surfaces**  
  Deploy agents anywhere: chat interfaces, custom apps, backend services.

Brinpage is designed as infrastructure: one platform to define behavior, connect data, and run AI across your products.
