**BrinPage** builds developer-first AI infrastructure.  
We develop modular systems that make working with large language models easier, scalable, and production-ready.

Our first product, **CPM (Context Prompt Manager)**, is a local SDK + dashboard for managing modular prompt logic — seamlessly connected to **BrinPage Cloud**, where API's and billing are handled.

## What we do

BrinPage focuses on building **infrastructure-grade AI tooling** for developers and teams that want to integrate models efficiently and safely.

- **CPM SDK** — Local-first SDK and dashboard (running on localhost:3027) to create, edit, and preview modular prompt contexts, and manage AI models — including temperature, output length, and embeddings — all from the frontend.  
- **BrinPage Cloud** — Centralized platform to manage API keys, handle billing, and monitor usage across your products.

> Every request routes securely through BrinPage Cloud — no BYOK, no setup. You build, we handle infrastructure.

## CPM — Context Prompt Manager

**CPM** brings precision and efficiency to prompt engineering through modular context management.

- **Modular design** – Build reusable prompt modules (facts, style, tone, behaviors...) that are only included when relevant.  
- **Smarter context** – Each request assembles just the information needed, reducing token usage and improving model accuracy.  
- **Live preview** – Visualize the full prompt exactly as the model will receive it.  
- **Cloud-connected** – All requests are routed through BrinPage Cloud for real-time tracking and cost optimization.  
- **Consistent workflow** – Keep prompts versionable, governed, and aligned across teams and environments.
